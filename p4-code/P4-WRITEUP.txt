Answer the questions below according to the project specification. Write
your answers directly in this text file and submit it along with your
code.


PROBLEM 1: sumdiag_OPTM()
=========================

  Do your timing study on csel-keller1250-NN.cselabs.umn.edu


(A) Paste Source Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Paste a copy of your source code for the function `sumdiag_OPTM()'

(B) Timing on csel-kh1250-NN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Paste a copy of the results of running `sumdiag_benchmark' on
  csel-kh1250-NN.cselabs.umn.edu in the space below which shows how your
  performance optimizations improved on the baseline codes.

(C) Optimizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Describe in some detail the optimizations you used to speed the code
  up.  THE CODE SHOULD CONTAIN SOME COMMENTS already to describe these
  but in the section below, describe in English the techniques you used
  to make the code run faster.  Format your descriptions into discrete
  chunks such as.
        Optimization 1: Blah bla blah... This should make run
        faster because yakkety yakeety yak.

        Optimization 2: Blah bla blah... This should make run
        faster because yakkety yakeety yak.

        ...  Optimization N: Blah bla blah... This should make run
        faster because yakkety yakeety yak.
  Full credit solutions will have a least two optimizations and describe
  WHY these improved performance in at least a couple sentences.

PROBLEM 2: Timing Search Algorithms
===================================

  Do your timing study on csel-kh1250-NN.cselabs.umn.edu. In most cases,
  report times larger than 1e-03 seconds as times shorter than this are
  unreliable. Run searches for more repetitions to lengthen run times.


(A) Min Size for Algorithmic Differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Determine the size of input array where one starts to see a measurable
  difference in the performance of the linear and logarithmic
  algorithms.  Produce a timing table which includes all algorithms
  which clearly demonstrates an uptick in the times associated with some
  while others remain much lower.  Identify what size this appears to be
  a occur.

(B) Linear Search in List vs Array
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Determine whether the linear array and linked list search remain
  approximately at the same performance level as size increases to large
  data or whether one begins to become favorable over other. Determine
  the approximate size at which this divergence becomes obvious. Discuss
  reasons WHY this difference arises.

(C) Binary Search in Tree vs Array
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Compare the binary array search and binary tree search on small to
  very large arrays. Determine if there is a size at which the
  performance of these two begins to diverge. If so, describe why this
  might be happening based on your understanding of the data structures
  and the memory system. If not, describe why you believe there is
  little performance difference between the two.

(D) Caching Effects on Algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  It is commonly believed that memory systems that feature a Cache will
  lead to arrays performing faster than linked structures such as Linked
  Lists and Binary Search Trees. Describe whether your timings confirm
  or refute this belief.  Address both types of algorithms in your
  answer:
  - What effects does Cache have on Linear Search in arrays and lists
    and why?
  - What effects does Cache have on Binary Search in arrays and trees
    and why?

(E) OPTIONAL MAKEUP CREDIT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  If you decided to make use of a table of function pointers/structs
  which is worth makeup credit, describe your basic design for this
  below.
